## Markdown

_email-style writing for the web by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz_

-   **Markdown** (web: [daringfireball.net/projects/markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)) - original Markdown syntax write-up and processor in Perl by John Gruber; no longer maintained (last update in December 2004)

History / Genesis

-   [Introducing Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/2004/03/introducing_markdown) by John Gruber - March 15, 2004
    
    > I've written a text-to-HTML formatting tool called Markdown, which is now available for download. Markdown allows web writers to compose text using a simple, readable, plain text formatting syntax; Markdown takes care of translating it to valid XHTML (or, if you prefer, HTML).
    
-   [Dive into Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/2004/03/dive_into_markdown) by John Gruber - March 19, 2004
    
    > You don't need to "preview" an email before you send it -- you write it, you read it, you edit it, right there.
    > 
    > In fact, I love writing email. Email is my favorite writing medium. I've sent over 16,000 emails in the last five years. The conventions of plain text email allow me to express myself clearly and precisely, without ever getting in my way.
    > 
    > Thus, Markdown. Email-style writing for the web.

    > For months I've been working with John Gruber on a new project. The idea was to make writing simple web pages, and especially weblog entries, as easy as writing an email, by allowing you to use much the same syntax and converting it automatically into HTML.
    > 
    > Together we pored over the syntax details from top to bottom, trying to develop the perfect format, and I think we've got something pretty darn great. We've tested it extensively: on our blogs, in my comments form, in our emails.
