### Editors

> Markdown, LaTeX, and reStructuredText are the three useful languages. **In most cases, a tweakable text editor such as [Visual Studio Code, aka vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is good enough.** In fact vscode comes with a enormous amount of extensions which can be used to build your own IDE.
