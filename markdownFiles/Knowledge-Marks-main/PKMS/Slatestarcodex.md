A very powerful trick is to write notes in the way Andy Matuschak writes them:

-   Give your note taking a direction by building notes up until they are _evergreen notes_: [https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)
-   Use positively worded propositional phrases as note titles

-   Create "speculative outlines" to shape your thinking and writing: [https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Create_speculative_outlines_while_you_write](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Create_speculative_outlines_while_you_write)
-   Give your note taking a direction by building up _executable strategies_:

-   Example of why this is powerful -- outlines become "theories" chaining together propositions, each of which is a link to details on that concept: [https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr)

Here's an example from my own notes showing the progression of "strengths" of note titles in my Zettelkasten: [https://i.imgur.com/WCJocOn.png](https://i.imgur.com/WCJocOn.png)

> I'm basically asking if you know a place which might teach me on what one might use it like, rather than a guide on how to access the features one has decided one wants to use.

Yes, that is the Zettelkasten method I mentioned, and the sub I linked above. It is application agnostic, and some people actually maintain one entirely with paper note cards as was done in the past. But of course a good tool can make the process much better, and Obsidian is a pretty good tool. And all notes you create are maintained in markdown files on your local computer.

> I'm sorry if my question isn't presented well. This is all very novel but I have a sense that it might be very large and paradigm-shifting if I understood it better.

These are very good questions to ask! You are correct this is a huge change in how you take notes and it dramatically alters your _thinking_ as well.

Lion Kimbro wrote a 2003 ebook called _How to make a map of every thought you think_ and while it is _very_ rambly and _very_ outdated (it was about carrying paper binders around) he absolutely nailed something that is core to this ZK approach -- it _structures your thinking_ such that you build up a mental schema that is reflected in the (well written, properly structured) ZK and _the ZK begins shaping your thinking and affecting your mental schema_. What happens is the more knowledge you feed into it and the more knowledge you develop with it the more it starts to feel like an _alien lifeform_ (to steal David Bowie's description of the Internet in 1999), an organic creature that takes on a life of its own. It becomes an _amoeba_ that drives you to seek out new knowledge in specific directions, or enables you to pause and not worry about seeking more in that direction because you have enough and can refer to it later if you want -- and at _that_ time you may be driven to seek more in that direction based on your then-current interests.

It really is a life changing way of taking notes. Spending time learning the note taking principles and applying them (rather than getting caught up in the _mechanics_ of types of notes and intricate workflows) is extremely powerful. (I have a note with something like 70 links to note taking principles I've found or worked out on my own, it's a deep topic)

Enjoy the journey!
