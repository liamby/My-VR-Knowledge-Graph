## Writing a bio

üö´a UX Designer with a desire to empower users through emphatic storytelling & intuitive design.  
üö´Designer with a passion for all things visual.

üö´I make beautiful, intuitive pixel-perfect user interfaces  
  
Tip #1: How can you make your bio uniquely yours? Bios can be one of the toughest things to write, but spending time making yours unique is worth it. I‚Äôve given feedback on hundreds of portfolios in the past couple years, and see the same bios over and over. The same buzzwords: passion, empathetic, storytelling, empower users, intuitive, clean, delightful experiences, etc.   
  
Tip #2: Important! Make sure you call yourself what you want to be hired for. Unless your work is wildly irrelevant, people that come to your portfolio will see what you call yourself and will take your word for it. It‚Äôs their first impression of you. I almost always encourage designers to drop ‚ÄúJunior‚Äù in front of their title on their portfolio. Just say Designer.
