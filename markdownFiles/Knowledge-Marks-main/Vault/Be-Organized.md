## Be-Organized

### Version Control System

> First things first, everyone should know version control system, aka VCS. VCS helps us track changes in our documents as well as collaborations on the documents. Needless to say, version control is one of the most useful tools for scientists.

  * **git**
  * svn
  * mercurial

#### Online Git Service

  * [GitHub](https://github.com/): the most popular platform for git with social and collaborations built-in. 
    * GitHub also provides GitHub Actions. With Actions one could automate processes.
    * GitHub provides GitHub Pages. With GitHub Pages, on could host static files as well as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) built websites.
  * [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/): similar to GitHub, GitLab provides git hosting, collaborations, social, automations, and more. GitLab can be both cloud-based and self-hosted using its open-source code. 
    * GitLab includes unlimited free private repositories.
    * GitLab comes with a continuous integration tool that is more powerful than GitHub Actions.
  * [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org): Alternative to GitHub and GitLab with free private repositories.

#### Self-hosted Git Server

  * [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/): See above at Online Git Service.
  * [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/): Painless self-hosted Git service written in Go.
  * [Gogs](https://gogs.io/): A painless self-hosted Git service.

#### Enterprise Git Service

  * [RhodeCode](https://rhodecode.com/): Centralized control for distributed repositories. Mercurial, Git, and Subversion under a single roof.

### Pomodoro

> [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) can be used to boost your productivity and probably improve your health. There are almost infinite choices for the tools.

  * [Pomotodo](https://pomotodo.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Chrome`): A mix of todo list and pomodoro timer, with sync across devices and weekly report [Free].
  * [Tadam](https://tadamapp.com/) (`Mac`): Simple and elegant pomodoro timer [USD$ 4.99].
  * [Productivity Challenge Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wlxd.pomochallenge&hl=en) (`Android`): Pomodoro timer with great gamification features [Free].

### GTD-Task Manager

> The GTD (Getting Things Done) method unloads the todo lists off the mind by recording them using external tools. It allows one to focus on one active task instead of on all of them ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)). Tasks can be classified in contexts (@home, @computer, @office, etc), time of action (now, next actions, scheduled or someday) and projects. [Here](https://hamberg.no/gtd/) we have a good pragmatic guide to GTD and [here](https://gettingthingsdone.com/pdfs/tt_workflow_chart.pdf) is a flowchart.

  * [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`,`Chrome OS`): Almost perfect todo lists with cooperation and sharing.
  * [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com/)(`Cloud`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Chrome OS`)
  * [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`,`Win Store`): Not so lightweight but still very good for managing life especially since it has got a lot of integrations from a lot of other services.
  * [Anydo](https://www.any.do/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Android`,`iOS`): Good because it has a very good daily review which can help users remember what to do.
  * [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Android`,`iOS`): Todoist invented the karma system which keeps track of the tasks done.
  * [Taskade](https://taskade.com/) (`Cloud`,`Mac`,`Win`,`Chrome OS`,`Firefox`,`Android`,`iOS`): Taskade is a collaborative task list and outliner for team projects.
  * [Agenda](https://agenda.com/)(`Mac`): Date-focused note taking.
