## Get Rid of Margin Hacks With Flexbox

When working with column gutters you can get rid of `nth-`, `first-`, and `last-child` hacks by using flexbox's `space-between` property:

```css
.list {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.list .person {
  flex-basis: 23%;
}
```

Now column gutters always appear evenly-spaced.
