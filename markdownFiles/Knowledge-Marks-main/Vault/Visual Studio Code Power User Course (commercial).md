After 10 years with Sublime Text, [Ahmad Awais](https://twitter.com/MrAhmadAwais/) switched to VSCode, built [Shades of Purple theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ahmadawais.shades-of-purple), and spent over a 1,000 hours perfecting his setup. He has launched a VSCode Power User Course to help you switch today. You can bring all your custom settings from the previous editor and learn the power user workflows for HTML/CSS, Git/GitHub & Open Source, supercharged Markdown, and everything from JavaScript to PHP, Go, Python, C++, C#, ROR. In this course, you'll also learn to install/setup 50+ Extensions.
