## Contract

ALWAYS USE A CONTRACT. I repeat, DO NOT WORK WITHOUT A CONTRACT. Even if it’s a “quick gig” or project for a friend. After your first call where you gather the project overview and objectives, send a proposal outlining the scope of the project (what you will do, in X amount of time). Sometimes they’ll give you a strict timeline — in that case, tell them what you will accomplish in that timeframe and lay it out on a timeline. Get them to agree to it in writing, and then send them a contract. Sometimes, I send the proposal and contract together. Whenever possible, get 50% payment upfront.

🧠 Most important tips I learned while freelancing:

  * Define scope upfront: decide what this project will and — v important — will NOT include. 
  * Any requests outside of scope should be charged at your hourly rate. Avoid scope creep, and stand your ground on only doing work that is within scope — otherwise you could have a never ending, dragged out project that lasts 8 months when you thought it would only take 1-2 🙃
  * Double the time you think it’ll take. Triple your rate. If they push back on your rate/project fee, it’s a good thing. You can always reduce the scope of work to fit their budget, but don’t reduce your rate — it could come off like you don’t value your own services and your worth.
  * Ask other designers doing similar work how much they charge. You’re probably not asking for enough 🤑

I usually send a Proposal and Scope of Work (SOW)—if you plan on working with the client again in the future, you can send a Master Services Agreement (MSA) and a new SOW per project.
