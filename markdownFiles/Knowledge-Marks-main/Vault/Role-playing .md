> Look for jobs that excite you, for jobs you think you can do with just a little ramp-up time. And then apply for those jobs, knowing that most of them will ignore you‚Äîbut it only takes one yes to get an exciting new job, and an exciting new opportunity to learn new skills.

> Whenever you feel yourself with too much work to do, go back and apply these principles: underpromise, limit your own time, prioritize ruthlessly. With practice you‚Äôll learn how to deliver the results that really matter‚Äîwithout working long hours.

> -   You are moving too fast. Overwhelmed with everything, good or bad, happening around.
> -   Life is too short (really) to zoom past it.
> -   People who survive (and grow) are the ones who stay in the moment, concentrate and strive to deliver their best.
> -   Quality never comes from rushing through things.
> -   Just because you can do so many things doesn‚Äôt mean you should attempt all of them.
> -   Rushing too fast through these is a risk, it is a killer. You never savor the moment, be in the present and enjoy the process. You end up ‚Äòdoing‚Äô so much that there is no time to ‚Äòruminate‚Äô

> -   Take responsibility for your own happiness at work.
> -   Find something to be thankful for every time you complain or feel annoyed : Make a list of five things that you appreciate about your job every day.
> -   Change things that upset you about your workplace if it is in your power to do so.
> -   Try something new. People often feel discontent at work when they are bored or unchallenged.
> -   Avoid others with negative attitudes.

-   [Shelley Frost](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/maximize-job-satisfaction-21414.html) - (2012) How to Maximize Job Satisfaction

> 1.  Write a list of the benefits and positive aspects of your job
> 2.  List the parts of your job that take away from your satisfaction.
> 3.  Identify the factors on your list of job negatives that you can change.
> 4.  Create an action plan for changing the negative aspects of your job.
> 5.  Educate yourself through training sessions or additional degrees to open up more opportunities at work.
> 6.  Set your own goals at the office to give yourself something to work toward.
> 7.  Participate actively in workplace decisions and communication when possible.
> 8.  Set boundaries for work by only performing work duties at the office.
> 9.  Remind yourself that you're fortunate to have a job in a tough economy. Refer to your list of positives about the job if you begin feeling negatively toward your work.

-   [Nancy Lovering](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/productive-work-perfectionist-22559.html) - (2013) How to Be More Productive at Work if You're a Perfectionist

> 1.  Measure progress instead of perfection. While quality is of utmost importance and should not be disregarded in favor of expedited task completion, finding a balance between getting it right and getting it done will allow you to be more productive.
> 2.  Recognize how perfectionism can actually reduce the quality of your work when it leads to procrastination. A common pitfall of perfectionists, procrastination leaves you with inadequate project completion time to get the results you are truly capable of.
> 3.  Stop comparing yourself to other employees. The urge to be competitive can enhance perfectionist tendencies.
> 4.  Consider what the company requires from you, rather than what you want to see from yourself. Task completion is critical to business workflow, and what your inner perfectionist sees as substandard work may actually be within the acceptable range to meet business needs.

-   [Shelley Frost](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/motivate-myself-work-11860.html) - (2012) How Do I Motivate Myself at Work?

> 1.  Write down factors that drain your motivation. Create a plan to deal with each of the motivation roadblocks.
> 2.  Identify your long-term career goals. Determine how your current job responsibilities will help you achieve those goals. Keep your future goals in mind to help you get through tasks you may not want to complete in your current position.
> 3.  Start your day with a positive thought. Set one positive goal for the day to motivate you toward success.
> 4.  Stop yourself when you begin with negative thoughts about your job. Reword the thoughts to turn them positive such as looking for alternative solutions rather than calling the current idea a failure.
> 5.  Dress professionally as a motivational force. Buy new work clothes as an extra incentive to work hard in the office.
> 6.  Reduce your stress levels to better deal with work tasks. Learn to breathe deeply and visualize success to keep stress levels in check.
> 7.  Take care of your physical needs through regular exercise, a healthy diet and sufficient sleep. When you feel better physically, you are better able to tackle work duties and stay motivated.
> 8.  Focus on your workplace successes. Look back at the professional moments that make you proud to motivate yourself to aim for further successful moments.

-   [Allen Holub](https://holub.com/noaccountability/) - (2021) #NoAccountability.

> -   The notion of accountability‚Äîand its lesser cousin, responsibility‚Äîoften pop up in the context of business, as if both of those ideas are good things. A culture of accountability, we‚Äôre told, is essential to running a business. I don‚Äôt buy any of it. A culture of accountability is actively destructive, and responsibility isn‚Äôt exactly positive, either.
> -   Also, the notion elevates the individual over the team. To me, effective teams are collaborative, and that applies recursively. The notion of ‚Äúindividual accountability‚Äù spits in the face of collaborative teamwork.
> -   Accountability is all about external force. You are accountable to your boss, who will punish you if you don‚Äôt succeed. You are accountable to your team, which will somehow punish you if you ‚Äúscrew up.‚Äù Responsibility is not much better. It‚Äôs implies self shaming: You are responsible for X. You took on that responsibility voluntarily! You should be ashamed that you didn‚Äôt do it!
> -   Both terms imply a culture of violence, to borrow a notion from Bob Marshall. Violence is not conducive to agility.
> -   A healthy relationship is about collaboration and sharing, not power. The words ‚Äúaccountable‚Äù and ‚Äúresponsible‚Äù simply won‚Äôt come up in the context of dishes (or anything else) in a healthy relationship. The drivers are love and respect, not obligation.
> -   At work, would you rather do a good job because you were responsible for something and held accountable when you fail, or because the work was gratifying and made you feel good?

-   [Steve Scott](https://www.happierhuman.com/stop-being-cynical/) - (2020) How to Stop Being Cynical: 11 Proven Strategies

> 1.  Admit to yourself that you are cynical.
> 2.  Embrace positivity.
> 3.  Practice gratitude.
> 4.  Breathe : Cynical people often hold their breaths without evening noticing this automatic defensive response. Practice breathing techniques, such as yoga, to oxygenate you and relax your thoughts.
> 5.  Be mindful.
> 6.  Be playful, even for just five minutes every day : Allow yourself to play, be curious, have fun, and lose track of time for those five minutes. This may involve enjoying art or listening to some of your favorite songs. Or, it could mean participating in sports or spending time with some of your favorite people.
> 7.  Limit your news consumption.
> 8.  Reveal your true self.
> 9.  Evaluate the company you keep : The people you spend time with influence your outlook. Examine the groups you follow on social media and the co-workers and other people you hang out with. Do they tend to be negative or positive?
> 10.  Spend more time with positive people : According to Jim Rohn, we are the average of the five people with whom we spend the most time. Choose to be surrounded by people who exude optimism and positivity while maintaining a realistic outlook.
> 11.  Look at people‚Äôs best qualities.

> -   Cynicism is part of a defensive posture we take to protect ourselves. It's typically triggered when we feel hurt by or angry at something, and instead of dealing with those emotions directly, we allow them to fester and skew our outlook.
> -   Another cause of cynicism is pretty simple: our brains are hard-wired to pay more attention to negative experiences. The more negativity we see in the world, the more likely we are to share that disposition with others. Over time, that tends to make us more cynical.
> -   Once you acknowledge your problem, you can start faking a more positive attitude until it sticks. For example, Redditor LionLeo's shares his "fake it till you make it" success.
> -   It just kind of came from more of a "go with the flow" attitude that I adopted overall and it's really made me a happier person. I used to deal with depression and anxiety and that's mostly gone away just because I adopted a positive attitude about things. Just try to be a little more enthusiastic about others (genuine or fake, just try it) and be interested in what they have to say.
> -   Something I always keep in mind to keep me in check is a quote from Bill Nye, "Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don't." When I think about it that way, people become more interesting to me.
> -   For me, it's less about the flowery idea of concentrating on the positive and more about not focusing on the negative. If I have something constructive to say, I'll say it. If it's pessimistic vitriol, I try to keep it to myself.
> -   Cynical assholes tend to surround themselves with other cynical assholes. It makes those long nights at the bar complaining about pop culture a lot more enjoyable. At some point, it's worth considering what impact these social relationships have on you.
> -   Breed Your Curiosity : I've noticed that the less time I focus on my snarky, cynical responses, the more likely I'll have an actually useful idea. I also tend to pay more attention to the world around me and stop to appreciate the creativity of others.
> -   Cynicism Isn't All Bad : The more we look at things critically with an emotional detachment, the more likely we'll be cynical about it. That's not always a bad thing, though. As Psychology Today points out, it's positive in small doses.
> -   Though cynicism may not be healthy in the long run, it can serve as an emotional coat of armor that blunts life's everyday indignities.
> -   Casting a cynical eye on situations you can't control reduces your emotional attachment to a particular outcome, says Yapko, and actually lowers your vulnerability to depression.
> -   Cynics' propensity to spot setups and snow jobs before the rest of us also makes them socially valuable. Infamous cynic Maureen Dowd, for instance, did a Pulitzer-winning job of highlighting tragic flaws in the Clinton administration. "Cynics deserve more respect than they get," Bayan says. "You need naysayers who will shout down ideas that are extreme or just plain foolish."

-   [Sarah Todd](https://qz.com/work/1790859/how-to-deal-with-cynical-coworkers/) - (2020) The secret to dealing with cynics at work

> -   one way to break the cycle of cynicism and disrespect may be to help people feel more empowered.
> -   the boss should also ask more about his professional goals. Perhaps he could suggest a conference the company could pay for him to attend, or a new project that he could head up
> -   If you recognize some cynical tendencies within yourself, you might also keep an eye out for ways to empower yourself within your job. After all, the lesson is clear: Cynicism just doesn‚Äôt pay.
