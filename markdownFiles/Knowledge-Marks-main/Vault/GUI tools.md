  * [Ceaser](https://matthewlein.com/tools/ceaser) \- Now that we can use CSS transitions in all the modern browsers, let's make them pretty. I love the classic Penner equations with Flash and jQuery, so I included most of those. If you're anything like me*, you probably thought this about the default easing options: “ease-in, ease-out etc.” The mysterious cubic-bezier has a lot of potential, but was cumbersome to use. Until now. Also, touch-device friendly!
