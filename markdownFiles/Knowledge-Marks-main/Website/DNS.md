##  DNS
* [Amass](https://github.com/caffix/amass) - The amass tool searches Internet data sources, performs brute force subdomain enumeration, searches web archives, and uses machine learning to generate additional subdomain name guesses. DNS name resolution is performed across many public servers so the authoritative server will see the traffic coming from different locations. Written in Go.
* [findsubdomains](https://findsubdomains.com/) - Automatically scans different sources to collect as many subdomains as can. Validate all the data through various tools and services to provide correct results without waiting.
