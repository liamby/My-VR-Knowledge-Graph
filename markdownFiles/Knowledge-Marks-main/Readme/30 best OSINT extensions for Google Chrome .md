# 30 best OSINT extensions for Google Chrome – osintme.com

---
Today a quick post listing some essential OSINT utilities for the Google Chrome browser.

Browser extensions are something that every self-respecting OSINT investigator should use and be familiar with.

They can be hugely helpful in terms of ease of use and managing the flow of your investigation – not to mention a productivity improvement.

**One important caveat:** When engaging in sensitive investigations where user identity and digital footprint can adversely impact your operational security, it might be a good idea to use a default, clean installation of a browser, with no extensions on it.

Websites you visit can profile you by your user agent and detect the extensions your browser has installed – so just be aware of it before you add all of the 30 extensions listed below into your browser!

I have used all of these OSINT focused Chrome extensions and I can attest to the fact they are working well (at least at the time of writing) – some better than others, that’s why I included potential functional duplicates here.
